Hot take: people greatly overstate the difficulty of first year at UofT. 

At the same time this take also doesn't apply to everyone, given that people have differing backgrounds, expectations, and experiences leading up to university. But for most people, I think first year is far more manageable than users on Reddit and other platforms make it out to be.
